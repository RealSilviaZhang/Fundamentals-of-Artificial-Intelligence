Introduction:
The CSP Heuristics for State Coloring Problem is a Python program that solves the State Coloring Problem using two heuristics: Minimum Remaining Values (MRV) and Least Constraining Value (LCV). This program is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook called csp_heuristic.ipynb.

Files:
csp_heuristic.ipynb: The Jupyter Notebook containing the implementation of the MRV and LCV heuristics.
report.pdf: The report detailing the implementation and results of the program.

Usage:
To run the program and obtain the solution for the State Coloring Problem, follow these steps:
    Open the Jupyter Notebook csp_heuristic.ipynb in a Jupyter Notebook environment.
    Run all the cells in the notebook.
    The program will generate the solution, which will be displayed in the output.

Solution:
The program will output the solution in the following format:
Solution found:
State1 = color1
State2 = color2
State3 = color3
State4 = color4
State5 = color5
State6 = color6
T = Any color (Since Tasmania is not adjacent to any other state)

The solution assigns colors to each state on the map such that no two adjacent states have the same color. The "T" state, representing Tasmania, can be assigned any color since it is not adjacent to any other state.

Dependencies:
The program does not have any external dependencies apart from a Jupyter Notebook environment with Python 3.

Compatibility:
The program has been tested on multiple operating systems and environments and is guaranteed to run successfully.

Note: Make sure to have the Jupyter Notebook environment set up with Python 3 before running the program.
