Simulated Annealing Implementation for 8-queens problem
	This repository contains an implementation of the Simulated Annealing algorithm to solve the N-Queens problem. The N-Queens problem involves placing N queens on an NÃ—N chessboard such that no two queens threaten each other.

Usage
	Download the ipynb Jupyter Notebook file.
	Install Python 3.x if you haven't already.
	Launch Jupyter Notebook.
	Open the ipynb file in Jupyter Notebook.
	Modify the parameter settings in the notebook cells.
	Run the notebook cells to execute the Simulated Annealing algorithm.
	Review the program's output, including the final board configuration, number of attacks, and elapsed time.
	Repeat with different parameter settings to observe the algorithm's performance.

Please note that the program may take some time to converge depending on the parameter settings and system capabilities.
